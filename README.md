# CheckEverything

Procedure verification tool, applied after the completion of maintenance in the laboratory, with the purpose of reducing potential errors. 
Internally used within the company by the in-house hardware maintenance team.

Additionally, the tool can save the checklist in PDF format to be attached upon task completion in the service desk system. It also enables the inclusion of equipment hardware information, 
which is collected by the script I developed, named InvScript, available in its repository.
